This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the valid range of the vector. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.
